#### Project Status: Complete

## Motivation
Nashville Software School's Data Science cohort was approached by Vanderbilt's Advanced Computing Center for Research and Education (ACCRE) to 

## Project Goals
1a. Were there lots of small jobs submitted together as an array?
1b. Were there lots of small jobs submitted together within a 4-hour window, regardless of whether or not they were in an array? 
2. Are any of these short jobs failing? 
3. What groups are best optimizing their memory usage in terms of percent of actual memory used of the memory requested for a job?
4. If jobs are weighted by runtime, what is the average percent of memory used of the requested memory for each group?
